# Accessibility standards

Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone. All components follow the WCAG AA standards.

All patterns are perceivable, operable, and understandable to users, even when using a screen reader or other assistive technology. However, how you use these elements also affects the accessibility of a product.
